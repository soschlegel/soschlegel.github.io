## List of Plugins

### Bracket Pair Colorizer

The Plugin **Bracket Pair Colorizer** ([CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer)) helps you to get a better overview even with complex expressions with many brackets by assigning different colors to different bracket pairs - a must have e.g. for Javascript developers.
